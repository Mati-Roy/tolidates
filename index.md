# My dating profile

**Tl;dr: Read only what‚Äôs in bold**


# Bounty

**Bounty: 3,500 USD**

**I'm offering 2,000 USD **for someone I end up having a child with (ie. being a legal parent with them; a sperm donation wouldn‚Äôt count) that you‚Äôve introduced me to and who wasn‚Äôt already a prospect. If someone reached out to me as a result of you sharing my profile on social media, that counts too. Paid only for the first child I have, and after a month of existence.

My good friend [Alton](https://www.facebook.com/AltonSun) offered an additional 1,000 USD to support me ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Äì ze said:


    I'll add $1000 to the bounty for the referral of someone who is with you and brings you a lot of joy for 18+ months because I love celebrating love. I'd want to have the option to have a 2 hour call with you both at that time window as a strong preference but not necessary.

**My friend [Toli](https://www.facebook.com/tolicodes) also offered an additional 500 USD** to support me ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Äì ze said:


    I will 50% match that bounty ($500) with the same conditions üôÇ I don't know Mati *that well* (yet). But very much interested in seeing him find a partner and taking apart how he did it

Here's [Toli's own bountified dating profile](http://tolidates.com/) (with a much larger bounty ^_^).

A few more notes:



* **Introductions can be done through any channel, such as [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09) or email (mathieu.roy.37@gmail.com).**
* I can stop taking new applicants for this bounty at any time (but, obviously, not retroactively).
* The money is to incentivize you to take the time to read my profile and recommend me to friends, and to generally reward superconnectors which I think tend to be undervalued. The money is just a bonus on top of the gratitude^_^


# General

No need to read (all) my profile to reach out to me.

While I‚Äôm open to other types of relationships, this profile is written with the goal of finding someone to raise children with. I'm 31 years old (born in October 1990), and generally prefer closer to my age, but +/- 13 years is fine.

When I first started writing this, it turned out I first wrote [My current lifeplan](https://matiroy.com/writings/My-life-plan.html). I think it‚Äôs very relevant to this, but I‚Äôll be including relevant information directly here.


# Looks


![alt_text](images/image1.jpg "image_tooltip")


![alt_text](images/image2.jpg "image_tooltip")


A lot of dating profiles start with pictures, so I suppose that‚Äôs important for most people, so here are some pictures: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/kLW4zMfwi7otDN4T7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kLW4zMfwi7otDN4T7).

**I measure 188 cm (6'2).** I just weighted myself, and I was at 93.6 kg (206 lbs).

I'm mostly attracted to personalities. My only physical preference worth mentionning is that I‚Äôm attracted to people that look healthy. I generally prefer no (or little or artistic) makeup, but I don‚Äôt really mind.


# On getting to know each other

We can, but don't have to "go on dates". You can also just reach out to me because I seem interesting, and not force anything specific.

I'm also into [live-in culture](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09/posts/10159949015054579): I think it's an efficient way to get to know someone to live with them very early on for a pre-determined amount of time (with the option to bail out at any point of course, and none of the usual expectations most people might have about living together) ‚Äì this is not at all needed if you're not into that; it's just an option.

I invite you to be yourself. I encourage to not avoid doing anything you want to do in relation with me just "because it's weird".


# Relationship

**I would like a partner with whom I can connect deeply**, know each other very well and develop great models of each other, share about what's going on in our lives, and be open about our internal experiences. Provide support in each other's goals and aspirations, have each other's back, and deeply trust each other, and care about each other. Giving each other's affection. **Be a team working together. **Defaulting to assuming any issues that might arise isn't being done maliciously, and being comfortable bringing them up and collaboratively working on them. Being resilient, and working hard to address any potential issue. Trying hard to not split / live separately while raising children. Ideally being open to being lifelong partners, and if distance (emotional, physical, etc.) became wanted, still remain there for each other.


# Location

**I have a rather strong preference to work towards a US citizenship** (which would require living in the US unless I marry a US-American, in which case it wouldn‚Äôt be necessary).

**I would prefer to live in Central or North America longterm, but short-term I'm more flexible.**

**I'm totally okay with meeting remotely. I can also easily travel around** ‚Äì so if I travel to your city and it doesn't seem like a good match after our first meeting / date, that's totally fine.


# Relationship structure, romance, and sex

**Summary: Flexible**

I‚Äôm not promiscuous. I‚Äôve had close friends with whom I've liked to cuddle. I care about safe sex a lot. I‚Äôm panromantic, although I experience it differently with males and females. I‚Äôm more sexually attracted towards females in general. I tend to like to escalate slowly. Also, I wish this was the default, but I'm not sure it is, but it's obviously important to me that sex be enjoyable by all involved parties.

I would prefer to raise children with someone I‚Äôm romantically and sexually attracted too, but I‚Äôm also open to raising children with a platonic friend. I want to live under the same roof.

I‚Äôm open to a few possible structures.



* I‚Äôm open to monogamy.
* I‚Äôm open to a close Vee or triad (in which case some of the descriptions in this profile would need to be adjusted).
* I‚Äôm open to having some openness that‚Äôs well defined.
* I‚Äôm open to complete openness, but if we continue to have sex I would like it to be safe.


# Children


## Genetic code

**I‚Äôm open to using our own genetic code **to create our children. I‚Äôm fertile (I‚Äôve done a spermogram and got a person pregnant through a sperm donation).

I‚Äôm also open to using sperm and/or egg donation from people that have the following traits (to be discussed to integrate your own preferences in this model) to an extent we find more satisfactory than our own (and/or if you‚Äôre not fertile):



* Desire to live
* Rational
* Executive capabilities
* Prosocial
* Intelligent
* Hard working
* Mentally healthy
* Longtermist
* Similar communication style

I‚Äôve described some of those traits in more detail in the section ‚ÄúPersonality I‚Äôm interested in‚Äù.

I‚Äôm also open to using surrogate mothers.

I don‚Äôt want to adopt.


## Number

**I want at least 2 children**; my desire for number of children scales almost linearly with wealth, but I‚Äôm flexible.


## Upbringing

I'm flexible on this, we can discuss this together of course, but here are some of my thoughts.

**I want to have a parenting approach that is time-efficient:**



* I have started reading about strategies such as how to sleep train and potty train babies early
* I would like to have an au pair / nanny / live-in maid (although we're a triad or Vee, we could have a stay-at-home parent)
* I have a predisposition towards liking giving a lot of autonomy to children

**I would like to share responsibilities ~equally related to taking care of our children.**

**I don‚Äôt have a strong preference between homeschooling/unschooling them or not**, but I think it makes sense to give them the option if they seem autonomous and we have the capacity to support that (which seems likely; at least one of us would work remotely or we would have an au pair or employee at home).

Just like I record my life,** I have a strong preference to record our children **at least in some ways at least until they can make their own decision (because I think this might be important for [identity preservation](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/k8mwvvvpjMGcZLAKH/the-case-for-lifelogging-as-life-extension), as well as useful for [other reasons](https://matiroy.com/writings/Should-I-record-my-life.html)).

**I would like our children to learn English as a first language. **I might speak to them in French so they also know French.

**I would like to sign up our children for [cryonics](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html).**

While I eat an [ostrovegan diet](https://coda.io/d/Mati-userguide_d3kSIiPo-tN/Ethical-market-pressure_sudFK#_luNzW), I don‚Äôt have much of a preference for what you or our children eat, at least until they can make their own choices.


# Wealth


## Finances

I would like my partner and I to** maintain some separate finances, but also have some joint finances **for joint expenses, notably for our children. \


I would like a partner that is** financially capable** of generally supporting their share of mutual expenses, but, naturally, if someone is wealthier, this will provide positive externalities to the other person (as they might want to buy communal things the other person wouldn't want)

Beside expenses to save time, I'm generally pretty frugal, but I'm willing to be flexible on this. I like saving a lot because of the [power of compounding investments](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/07/15/two-fun-tools-from-the-mmm-software-department/)).

If a person contributes more in some non-financial ways (ex.: bearing a child, doing housework), then I think it can make sense for the other person to pay for their share of those.

I have a good income (ref. [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiroy/)) and aiming to make more money through entrepreneurship. My spendings has been pretty low, so I was able to put an important fraction of it aside, and I'm near a minimal level of financial independence.


# Personality I‚Äôm interested in

**_Which also corresponds to my personality._**


## Main traits

**Honest**. Honesty is very important to me ‚Äî at least meta-honest: being honest about your honesty. I would prefer someone that would never say literal false information with the intent to deceive a partner / me. I‚Äôm extremely honest.

**Values living**. I will connect fundamentally more with someone that values living. I would like someone for whom the best possible life is of infinite length ‚Äî literally never ending, not just a very very large number or an ‚Äúinfinite life‚Äù from which they would eventually bail out. It‚Äôs okay if they would prefer death over some imperfect infinite lives, but not over the best possible one. No specific beliefs about the feasibility of this needed. I would also prefer someone that is not at risk of suicide (medical aid in dying doesn‚Äôt count).

**Rational**. Not the na√Øve Spock version. But someone that is self reflective, not attached to their beliefs, passes cognitive reflections tests, dislikes self-deception, and prioritizes accuracy over political correctness (when communicating with me). I'd also include good self-knowledge here.

**Good executive capabilities**. I would like someone that at least answers their emails rapidly, doesn't forget their meetings, and generally has basic functional systems to operate in the world (such as to keep their kitchen and work office operational).

**Similar communication style**. [I lean ask/tell culture. I‚Äôm rather good at guess culture](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vs3kzjLhbdKsndnBy/ask-and-guess), and like using it sometimes, but it‚Äôs important to me that my partner is able to make their needs known explicitly if I fail at reading them, and be okay with me doing the same. I want someone that is open to receiving feedback ‚Äî I personally love feedback. I strongly dislike ‚Äúdeny culture‚Äù ‚Äî where someone says something that I need to deny, instead of asking me.

**Inspiring**. I‚Äôm influenced by my social environment, and I want to work hard and am ambitious. So I‚Äôm more inspired when living with hard working and/or ambitious and/or successful people. (Hardworking is also a valuable trait for taking care of our mutual responsibilities.)


## Other traits

The traits above were the most important. Here I'm just adding other trait I have and value, but don't worry about them.

**Mentally healthy**. Self explanatory. Low addictions would also be nice.

**Longtermist**. I value making decisions mostly in terms of their expected longterm consequences.

**Intelligent**. It's a spectrum.

**Adventurous**. I like someone that says yes to challenges. Finds it fun to sleep naked in a cold forest. Will do invisible improv and DIY [impractical jokers](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=impractical+jokers). Etc.

**Health-conscious**. I‚Äôd rather someone that doesn‚Äôt smoke cigarettes. I would prefer someone (at least) leaning towards a healthy diet.

I think I also like people that are **transparent**, **kind**, **empathic**, **caring**, **prosocial**, **confident **and** able to regulate their anger**.


# More information about me

Here is other information I anticipate people might want to have about me (those are not things I‚Äôm necessarily looking for in others).

I‚Äôve had some reviews on LinkedIn which I think are also relevant here: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiroy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiroy). My LinkedIn profile also has information about my career, obviously.

Other personality traits:

* My sleep schedule is flexible, and I can likely generally sync it to yours if you have a preference (I‚Äôve lived with a friend for 5 months, about 4 of which were synced).
* I tend to do exercise when I have someone with whom to do exercise. But my belief in the health benefits of exercise is not very strong.
* I don‚Äôt drink alcohol. I don‚Äôt smoke. I don‚Äôt take any drugs.

Knowledge (outside profession):



* I‚Äôve read a fair amount about topics related to moral philosophy, futurism, effective altruism, LessWrong, and transhumanism.
* I have good intuitions around economics.

Skills:



* I‚Äôm able to do most types of housework and (figure out) house repairs, but I generally prefer to outsource it
* I‚Äôm pretty good at understanding social interactions / situations in details
* I‚Äôm good at preventing and resolving conflicts

I‚Äôve had an OkCupid account for a very long time, and I‚Äôve answered many questions on it ‚Äî a bunch are probably not up-to-date, but you can check them out: [https://www.okcupid.com/profile/1024227943072844142/](https://www.okcupid.com/profile/1024227943072844142/).

To know more about me, I invite you to go the traditional route ‚Äì ie. stalking me; wait, no, I mean 1 on 1 interactions :P. You can easily stalk me though; I notably have a lot of Facebook posts ‚Äì feel free to send a friend request.

You can answer [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y8OLa1vYSVIpnj13G-e2R8IogkNmRveZDX4dmmsIfy4/) to let me know other information you would like me to include or think I should include in this profile, or for any feedback on it.
