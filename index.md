## Inspiration
Recently, [Mati Roy](https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09) wrote a Facebook post, as well as a detailed [dating profile](https://matiroy.com/writings/My-dating-profile.html) with a very unique idea - offering a $2,000 bounty to person who finds someone he ends up having a child with.

We are very much aligned on our approaches towards partnerships and relationships. So I decided to fork his document and write my own!

## Bounty 
I am offering a **$100,000** bounty to the person who sets me up with my life parter. Your bounty will be paid in the following installments, via check, wire, and/or crypto, based on a typical VC vesting schedule.

Upon introducing me to a prospective "life partner", we may start dating, and "officially" start our relationship.

### 1 Year Cliff
If the romantic, sexual, and/or "life partnership" relationship between myself and the candidate you referred is terminated before 1 year, a bounty shall not be issued.

Upon hitting our "1 year anniversary", you will be issued a lump sum of *$25,000*.

### 4 Year Vesting Schedule
As our relationship continues, you will be issued monthly payments for the first 4 years of the ongoing relationship.

### Example
- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate
- Dec 21, 2021: We end up liking each other, and go on our first "date"
- Dec 22-31, 2021: We go on multiple "dates" getting to know each other
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". As the matchmaker, you are now issued a lump sum of **$25,000**
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$2,083.33*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $25,000 + the monthly payments ($12,500). Totalling **$37,500**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point you have fully vested the full **$100,000** bounty

### Profit Sharing - Bet On Us Succeeding
This is very much a work in progress, but as an alternative to a bounty, you may instead opt to invest in a "profit sharing" model of our total net income.

It will follow the same vesting schedule as the regular bounty, but be based off our income at that time.

#### Happy Path Example
Let's assume the bounty is set at `10%` of our net income.

- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate. I am currently contracting for a fintech startup, grossing ~$25,000/mo. Let's assume my potential partner makes approximately the same amount. For simplify let's assume we net 60% of our gross salary after taxes and whatnot. So $25,000 * 2 * .6 = $30,000/mo net. Your monthly bounty is $3,000, assuming we stay at our current income levels, don't make any capital gains on investments, etc.
...
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". As the matchmaker, you are now issued 10% of our net tax combined tax return (let's say **$36,000**, assuming all of our salaries stay the same and other factors).
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$3,000*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $36,000 + the monthly payments ($18,000). Totalling **$54,000**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point you have fully vested the full **$144,000** bounty

#### Pessimistic Path Example
Here we assume our net income falls over time

- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate. I am currently contracting for a fintech startup, grossing ~$25,000/mo. Let's assume my potential partner makes approximately the same amount. For simplify let's assume we net 60% of our gross salary after taxes and whatnot. So $25,000 * 2 * .6 = $30,000/mo net. Your monthly bounty is $3,000, assuming we stay at our current income levels, don't make any capital gains on investments, etc.
...
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". Our net income actually drops by 50%. As the matchmaker, you are now issued 10% of our net tax combined tax return (let's say **$18,000**, assuming all of our salaries stay the same and other factors).
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$1,500*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $18,000 + the monthly payments ($9,000). Totalling **$27,000**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point you have fully vested the full **$72,000** bounty

#### Optimistic Path Example
Here we assume our net income grows over time

- Dec 20, 2021: You introduce me to a potential "life partner" candidate. I am currently contracting for a fintech startup, grossing ~$25,000/mo. Let's assume my potential partner makes approximately the same amount. For simplify let's assume we net 60% of our gross salary after taxes and whatnot. So $25,000 * 2 * .6 = $30,000/mo net. Your monthly bounty is $3,000, assuming we stay at our current income levels, don't make any capital gains on investments, etc.
...
- **Jan 1, 2022**: We officially "start" our relationship
- Dec 30, 2022: If we "break up" our "life partnership" (as defined by myself and the potential "life partner"), you will not be issued any bounty at this point
- **Jan 1, 2023**: We celebrate our "1 year anniversary". Our net income actually increases by 100%. As the matchmaker, you are now issued 10% of our net tax combined tax return (let's say **$72,000**, assuming all of our salaries stay the same and other factors).
- **Feb 1, 2023**: We celebrate our 13 month anniverary. You are issued your monthly payment of *$6,000*
- Jun 1, 2023: If we break up on month 18, you retain your $72,000 + the monthly payments ($36,000). Totalling **$108,000**
- **Jan 1, 2026**: At this point, we have exited out of our respective startups, and have netted $1,000,000. Uou have fully vested your bounty. So you collect a total of **$288,000** off of our net salary over the years, as well as 10% of the 1M (an additional **$100,000**. For a grand total of **$388,000**
